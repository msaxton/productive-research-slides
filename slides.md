### 2. Reference sources can help you find and/or narrow your research topic.

What is a reference source?

A reference source summarizes and synthesizes secondary sources. Typically, a reference source does not contain original research. These sources provide important background and contextual information on your topic.

Examples of reference sources:
* Dictionaries
* Encyclopedias
* Handbooks
* Bibliographies


### 3. Combine keywords and subject terms for efficient searching

* _Keywords_ are generated by the researcher (that's you!).
* Use the who, what, where, when, why, and/or how from your topic as keywords.

* Keywords ("Any field") searches:
    * title
    * author
    * table of contents / summary (if available)
    * subjects

* _Subject terms_ are generated by librarians to describe the main content a book or article.

#### How to find subject terms
1. Examine the subject terms associated with items returned from keyword searching.
2. Browse the subject terms used in the database.


### 4. There is no perfect database.

* Do I need primary or secondary sources?
* What kind of primary source do I need?
* Do I need a primary sources from a specific time period or region?
* What kind of secondary source do I need?
* Do I need a specific disciplinary focus like sociology or history?


### 5. Use Google, but use it wisely.

Using Google wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous searches.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### 6. Evaluate your sources

What makes for a good source?

#### Relevance
* For books: look through the index for your key terms.
* For articles: read the abstract for the main points.
* Skim the introduction to get a sense of the source.
* Check the bibliography to see what other authors this author is in conversation with.

#### Reliability
* Is it published by a reputable publisher?
* Is the author an expert in the field?
* Has the source been peer-reviewed?
* Does the source have sufficient notes and a bibliography?
* Has the source been well-received? (Book reviews and citations)


### 7. Document your research and manage your citations

* Maintain a research log to track database searches, keep an annotated bibliography, and take reading notes.
* [Sample research log](https://msaxton.notion.site/Sample-Research-Log-5d5743036c394ad184bab74eebf78acd)

* Use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or similar software to manage your citations.
